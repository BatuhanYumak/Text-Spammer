# Text Spammer

Text Spammer is a simple Python script designed for educational purposes to automate text input. This script utilizes the `pyautogui` library to simulate keyboard input, allowing users to send repetitive text messages with specified intervals.

## Start 

1. Go to virtual environment and download the requiered libaries in there
   ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-spammer.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui

# Usage

1. Create a text file containing the message you want to spam. Save it as theText.txt in the same directory as the script. I recommend putting the texts together like this

```text
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python or python3 main.py

3. Switch to the application or chat window where you want to spam the text.

4. The script will start typing the message line by line with a delay of 0.5 seconds between each line. Ensure you have enough time to switch to the desired window before the spamming begins.
